# CULDRouts.github.io

Welcome to the CULD Wiki! Personal Project by Mara Dominguez to try to make a lightweight, easily accessibly and editable information source for [Columbia University Lion Dance](culiondance.org)
# Some Stuff to start
- **Culd Wiki** is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). A Lightweight format for styling pages. 
- The Website is hosted using **Github Pages** This page will take you through the workflow for how to modify CULD Wiki! For now, we will only allow E-Board Collaborators, but it may change depending on how useful this website ends up being!


# Getting Started with Github
* First, install [Github Desktop](), and log in with CULD Credentials
* Then, Select **File -> Clone Repository** and clone the CULD Wiki into a folder you like

> If you already have Github, then start by Selecting the relevant Repository, and click **Pull Origin** (see the image below) before modifying things, to make sure you're in sync with everyone else!

# Editing the Files
* You should see something like you see below! From here, open one of the markdown Files with a markdown editor

## Markdown Editors 
* I haven't used [Caret](https://caret.io/), But it seems like it would get the Job Done and is simple enough for what we're looking for
* If you don't want it to be pretty, you could use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* Personally, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but that might be overkill for what we're looking for. 

From there, Edit the file however you want!

## Pushing your Work!
* When you're done making a change, add a Summary on the bottom left of Github Desktop, and then click **Commit to Main**, Do this for any medium-size changes you do

* When you're Completely Done, Push your work by clicking **Push Origin** on the top Right! Great job, you're done :3
